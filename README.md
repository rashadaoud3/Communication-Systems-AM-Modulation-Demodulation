# Communication Systems: AM Modulation and Demodulation Project

## About the Project
This project involves the simulation, design, and analysis of Amplitude Modulation (AM) and Demodulation. The main objectives are:
- **AM Modulation:** Generating an AM signal using a switching modulator circuit and evaluating it in both the time and frequency domain.
- **AM Demodulation:** Recovering the original message signal using an envelope detector circuit.

The project also includes both software simulation (MATLAB or PSpice) and hardware implementation on a breadboard.

## Deliverables:
- **Project Report** (3-4 pages)
- **Hardware Design** (with circuit diagram)
- **Short Presentation**
- **Demonstration of Results** (via oscilloscope for AM signals)

## Project Phases:

### Phase One: Simulation and Design 
- **Part 1: Normal AM Modulation**
    - Express modulating and carrier signals in both time and frequency domain.
    - Design a switching modulator and bandpass filter.
    - Use MATLAB or PSpice to simulate and plot results.

- **Part 2: Normal AM Demodulation**
    - Design and simulate an envelope detector.
    - Plot the demodulated signal.

### Phase Two: Breadboard Circuit Implementation 
- Implement the AM Modulator and Demodulator circuits on a breadboard.
- Capture and explain the modulated and demodulated signals using an oscilloscope.

## Requirements:
- **MATLAB or PSpice** (for simulations)
